This project applies K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to group data points into clusters based on feature similarity. K-Means is commonly used for customer segmentation, pattern recognition, and data compression.
Dataset:
The dataset contains multiple features used to group the data into K distinct clusters.
Steps:
1.Data preprocessing (scaling, cleaning, etc.)
2.Choosing the number of clusters using the Elbow Method
3.Applying the K-Means algorithm
4.Visualizing the clusters
5.Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster
Tools Used:
Python,Pandas,NumPy,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib / Seaborn
Result:
The K-Means algorithm successfully divided the data into meaningful clusters, helping identify patterns and similarities within the dataset.
